## Motivation  

This project explores the differences between the tools used by the highest-paid 20% of data scientists and the bottom 50% lowest-paid. As well as the differences in how they approach learning.

## Summary of the analysis results   
I collected data from the Stack Overflow and Kaggle 2021 surveys answered by thousands of data scientists. I cleaned up the data to consider only full-time employed data scientists and ML engineers who openly answer questions of interest. Then I created two subsets, the first containing wages equal to or less than the median and the other containing wages above the 0.8 quantiles. Finally, I explored various correlations, contrasting both subsets. In the end, I drew the most interesting findings in an explanatory way.

The tools you use, and the way you approach learning can have a significant correlation with how much you get paid for your work as a data scientist.
