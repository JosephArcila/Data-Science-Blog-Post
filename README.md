## Dependencies
- Python 3.8.10

## Motivation
This project aims at exploring if there are some differences between the tools used by the top 20% highest-paid data scientists from the bottom 50%. As well as the differences, if any, in how they approach learning.
For this project, I leverage data from the Stack Overflow and Kaggle 2021 surveys answered by thousands of programmers.

## Files
datasets - This file contains the datasets of the 2021 Kaggle and Stack Overflow surveys.

Untitled.ipynb - The notebook contains the exploratory analysis and the explanatory visualizations with the functions used to create them.

## Technical Details
What were your results? What did you do to improve them? What methods did you try? What worked? What didn't work?

## Akcnowledgments
I would like to thank Udacity for motivating me and guiding me through my data scientist journey.
