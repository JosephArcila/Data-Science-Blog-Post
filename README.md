# Differences from Top Data Scientists
The tools you use, and the way you approach learning can have a significant correlation with how much you get paid for your work as a data scientist.

## Instalations needed to run the code  

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib 3
- Seaborn

## Motivation  

This project explores the differences between the tools used by the highest-paid 20% of data scientists and the bottom 50% lowest-paid. As well as the differences in how they approach learning.
